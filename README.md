&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Key Words: Hough Transform, Canny Edge Detection, Region Masking

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;I created an image processing pipeline to locate lane lines from a car dash camera. This pipeline was then proved on two different image streams.

### Traffic Sign Classifier Project (Self Driving Car Nanodegree)

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Relevant Links: [Git Repository](https://github.com/jbm950/SelfDrivingCarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier), [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jbm950/SelfDrivingCarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier)

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Key Words: Convolutional Neural Network, Data Set Augmentation, Neural Network Model Evaluation, Tensorflow

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;I created a convolutional neural network to be able to classify different types of german traffic signs. The data set contained 43 different traffic sign classes. The model had a validation accuracy of 95% over 4410 validation images and a test accuracy of 94% over 12630 test images.

### Behavioral Learning Car Driving Simulator Project (Self Driving Car Nanodegree)

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Relevant Links: [Git Repository](https://github.com/jbm950/SelfDrivingCarND-Behavioral-Cloning), [Main Project Script](https://github.com/jbm950/SelfDrivingCarND-Behavioral-Cloning/blob/master/model.py)

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Key Words: Convolutional Neural Network, Keras, Data Set Augmentation

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The project included use of a car driving simulator. The simulator records as you drive the car around circular tracks and pairs images with corresponding steering angles. This was used to create a data set to drive the car autonomously. After training the covnet model, the car was able to drive itself successfully around the track without user input.
